When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to work from different computers, or you want to work in a project from another person.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because maybe you discard the changes or you don't want other people to see something that it might not be full functional, etc.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks is only used in github and it clones a repository directly from github to github.
Clones copies a repository from github to local or grom locl  to local.
Branches refers to the same repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
If you are going to be inactive for a long period of time (i.e. holidays) you might want to know what changes have been made since then. In that case, it would make sense to have a copy of the last known state of the remote repository.
